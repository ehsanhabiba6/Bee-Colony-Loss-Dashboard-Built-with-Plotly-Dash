# Bee-Colony-Loss-Dashboard-Built-with-Plotly-Dash
While exploring AI concepts, I discovered Plotly Dash and created this interactive dashboard as part of my learning. It visualizes bee colony loss across U.S. states using real-world data. Users can explore insights by selecting different states and causes of colony loss, displayed through a dynamic scatter plot.
This project is an interactive dashboard built using Plotly Dash to visualize bee colony losses across U.S. states. The data used in this dashboard provides insight into how various factors such as pesticides, diseases, parasites, and environmental stressors contribute to the decline in honey bee populations.

📌 About the Project
While learning about AI, I came across the power of data visualization and dashboard creation. This inspired me to dive into Plotly Dash, a Python framework for building analytical web applications.

As a result, I built this project to:

Explore data storytelling using graphs.

Understand real-world issues (like the bee population crisis).

Enhance my Python and data visualization skills.

🔍 Features
Interactive Dropdowns: Select a U.S. state and a cause of colony loss to view specific data.

Scatter Plot Visualization: The chart dynamically adjusts point size based on the magnitude of loss, helping users easily identify trends and outliers.

Clean UI: Simple, user-friendly layout built with Dash components.
